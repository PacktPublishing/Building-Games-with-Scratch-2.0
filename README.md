# Building Games with Scratch 2.0 [Video]
This is the code repository for [Building Games with Scratch 2.0 [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/building-games-scratch-20-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781783283712), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Scratch 2.0 has one of the most user-friendly interfaces that allow you to create games and interactive animations easily. It is a good starting point for non-programmers who wish to learn basics of programming games, and quickly create and publish fun and interactive games. 

This video course shows you how to design and build several short games, then code and debug them, and finally publish and share them with the world. This course is a beginner’s guide to learning the basics of computer science and creating your own engaging and interactive games.

You will learn how to make a character respond to input from your computer keyboard, and how to get onscreen objects to interact with each other in increasingly complex ways. Along the way, you will create more visual variety, more interactive possibilities, and have more fun.

Following on from this, you’ll learn how to create a simple catch-and-avoid game, a ball-and-paddle “Breakout” game, a base-defence game, a point-and-click “Escape The Room” adventure game, and a maze game. You’ll learn to upload or create the artwork, how to control an onscreen object with a mouse, keyboard, or even by waving your hand in front of a webcam. We’ll also cover how to create some animation tricks, such as making a falling ball squish when it hits the floor, and making a character’s mouth move in synch with your own voice. Along the way, you’ll learn important computer science principles, such as if-then loops, iterative design, object-oriented programming, and debugging strategies.

Whether you are looking for a gentle introduction to computer science, a first step towards learning about the profession of computer programming, or you just want to have fun making games, this video course is here to help you at every step of the way.




This course teaches you the key aspects of this flexible data store. You’ll learn how a NoSQL data store such as Redis differs from traditional SQL databases that you may be more familiar with. You’ll see how to install the database on your own machine, or use a database provider in the cloud. You’ll also discover the basic native data types of Redis and how to use them.

From theory to application, Rapid Redis explains when, why, and how to use the Redis data store. We’ll discuss the differences between NoSQL and SQL, explore the Redis data types to see how to use them, and end up with an easy-to-understand Node.js example app that uses Redis as a cache.

No matter what kind of application you’re working on, you need a place to store your data. Rapid Redis gives you a new tool to add to your toolbox: a data store that is quick and easy to use, and far more powerful than you can imagine.
